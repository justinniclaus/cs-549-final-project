# Spam or Ham Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying messages as **spam** or **ham** (i.e., legitimate). The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, `spam_or_ham.ipynb`, and uses a dataset (`spam1.csv`) that contains labeled messages. The goal is to preprocess the data, build a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance in detecting spam messages.

## Project Overview

The **Spam or Ham Classification** project aims to classify messages as either spam or ham using machine learning. The project involves the following steps:

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Extraction:** Convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
- **Model Training:** Train a classification algorithm on the processed data.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to classify new messages.

## Dataset

The project uses the `spam1.csv` dataset:

- **Columns:**
  - `label`: Indicates whether the message is spam or ham.
  - `message`: Contains the text of the email/SMS message.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Removal of unwanted characters, lowercasing text, etc.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization of text data.
- **Classification:** Implementation of a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or another classifier) to distinguish spam from ham.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Calculation of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- **Visualization:** Generation of plots and charts to illustrate model performance (if implemented).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:
